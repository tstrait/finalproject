I am choosing to analyze the NBA dataset from the 2017-2018 regular season; datasets are available at stats.nba.com, and I also found a Kaggle dataset that has stats already aggregated, https://www.kaggle.com/pablote/nba-enhanced-stats/data, which I may use as well.

With the increase in data recorded & available in professional sports, we can look at a single player's impact from a numerical angle -- if the top player on a team has a great night, does that lead to a high probability the team will win?  Are there other stats that would predict a win?

By choosing the top 2-3 players on each team (will choose the top players by points scored throughout the season), I'd like to analyze whether those players' stats can predict whether their teams will win. My hypothesis is that a good night for the top player is likely to lead to a win for that team.  Success metrics here would include guaging the strength of correlation between top player points and team wins, or finding other stats that correlate highly.

I will have to do some close analysis and cleaning of the data - while I expect the datasets to be clean, I want to pull out any columns I won't be looking at right away, as there are probably more stats available than I actually want to focus on.
